# LinkedDungeon
YOUR NAME - A text-based RPG, with a Doubly-Linked List data structure.

## How to run:
Run Game.java.

## How to play:
You are an adventurer who has found themselves in a strange, circular labyrinth...
You endlessly descend as you hopelessly try and find your way out!
Input instructions are given to you once you start playing, so you won't need to worry.

### STATS:
HP: How much health you have. When HP < 0, it's game over!
ATK: How much damage you deal to monsters!
DEF: How much damage taken you reduce!
SPD: How fast you are! If you're faster than an enemy, you attack first!
MONEY: How loaded your pockets are! You can spend money at shops to get nice boons to help you die later rather than sooner!

### STUFF:
There's MONSTERS! Fight 'em!
There's ITEMS! Loot 'em!
There's SHOPS! Engage in facilitating the beautiful flow of commerce and currency!
There's TRAPS! Suffer 'em?
And... that's about it.

Have fun!
By the way, what's your name...?
